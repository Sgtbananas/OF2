🛠️ Patch List (To-Do/Upgrades, Docker Last)
1. Patch historical data fetching in orchestrator
Implement reliable, robust historical data loading in orchestrator.py:_fetch_historical_data.
Integrate with your actual data provider or database.
2. Add or patch MLFilter feature extraction unit tests
Create/expand tests for MLFilter.extract_features to ensure all columns, edge cases, and data types are handled correctly.
3. Patch Streamlit UI to integrate orchestrator and profile selection
User should only select profile (“conservative”, “normal”, “aggressive”).
Add dedicated buttons for “Dry Run” and “Live Run”.
The orchestrator handles all pipeline/model logic based on those settings.
4. Add logging to all major modules
Especially for orchestrator, MLFilter, trading engine.
Log key events (start/stop, errors, model choice, wins/losses, retrains, PnL).
5. Patch/extend CLI scripts for orchestrator
Add helpful commands for running, status, and error handling.
6. Patch requirements.txt/pyproject.toml
Ensure all dependencies are listed and versions pinned.
7. Add unit/integration tests for orchestrator and ML pipeline
Simulate backtest, retrain, deploy cycle.
Validate correct selection and retraining logic.
8. Patch README/documentation
Add orchestration, ML, retraining, and deployment instructions.
🔄 Automated Retraining Patch
Add a scheduler (e.g., background thread or cron) to the orchestrator to:
Periodically retrain the ML model (e.g., every N hours or after M new trades).
Re-run backtests and pipeline selection after retraining.
Log and notify when retraining happens.
🖱️ Streamlit UI Improvement Patch
Integrate new buttons into the UI:
“Dry Run” → Set mode to dry_run, run orchestrator.
“Live Run” → Set mode to live, run orchestrator.
Profile selection → Dropdown or radio, passed to orchestrator.
Display current mode, profile, and latest PnL/winrate.
